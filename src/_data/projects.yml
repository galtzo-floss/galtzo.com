  description: |-
    Allows customization of:
    * Specify which level of notification you would like with an array of optional styles of notification (email, webhooks)
    * the sender address of the email
    * the recipient addresses
    * the text used to prefix the subject line
    * the HTTP status codes to notify for
    * the error classes to send emails for
    * alternatively, the error classes to not notify for
    * whether to send error emails or just render without sending anything
    * the HTTP status and status code that gets rendered with specific errors
    * the view path to the error page templates
    * custom errors, with custom error templates
    * define error layouts at application or controller level, or use the controller's own default layout, or no layout at all
    * get error notification for errors that occur in the console, using notifiable method
    * Override the gem's handling and rendering with explicit rescue statements inline.
    * Hooks into `git blame` output so you can get an idea of who (may) have introduced the bug
    * Hooks into other website services (e.g. you can send exceptions to to Switchub.com)
    * Can notify of errors occurring in any class/method using notifiable { method }
    * Can notify of errors in Rake tasks using NotifiedTask.new instead of task
    * Works with Hoptoad Notifier, so you can notify via SEN and/or Hoptoad for any particular errors.
    * Tested with Rails 2.3.x, should work with rails 2.2.x, and is apparently not yet compatible with rails 3.
